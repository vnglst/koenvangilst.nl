When I was a kid in high school, a friend and I would exchange floppy disks with demos on them. At that time I was happy to be able to draw a couple of circles on the screen so I was very impressed when he showed me his demo. It was similar to this and it even had movement. I couldn't believe he was able to do that (I still think he had help from his father!).
