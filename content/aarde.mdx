Old school artificial life. Inspired by [Tierra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_(computer_simulation)), in a much simplified form.

The programming language in which the life forms are written has 5 instructions:

- S - Program start 
- E - Program end 
- F - Find location to copy to 
- C - Copy to location
- J - Jump to start of program

Every time a code is copied a mutation can occur. We start with the following simple life form:

SFCJE

The rest is evolution.
