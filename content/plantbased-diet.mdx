Over the last couple of years, I've become more conscious of my diet and how it's affecting the world around us. I’ve come to realize that it’s not just meat that’s a problem, but dairy as well. The book [Regenesis](https://koenvangilst.nl/blog/regenesis-reading-notes) by George Monbiot has played an important role in that.

Key arguments for a more plant-based diet have been:

1. Eating animals is a highly inefficient way to produce food. We’re currently feeding our cows and pigs the grain and maize that many people around the world can no longer afford due to the global food crisis.
2. Livestock is polluting our environment. It emits many times more greenhouse gases than food grown as crops. The manure produced by the millions of livestock animals is destroying our ecology and polluting our water.
3. Intensive livestock farming is cruel and immoral. Cows, pigs and chickens are being held in the most terrible of circumstances.
4. Livestock farming is a dangerous source of new pandemics, so-called zoonosis: infectious diseases that jump from animals to humans. Examples of these are ebola, salmonella, Spanish flu, swine flu and Covid-19.

I’m constantly re-adjusting my view on this and I’m open to new insights so feel free to reach out to me if you have any other insights or recommendations.
