As a Frontend developer at Stichting Dedicon, I developed a specialized audiobook player for users with visual impairments. The Online Player (OLP) offers multiple reading assistance features including:

- Text highlighting that syncs with human narration
- Adjustable reading speed
- Customizable font size and color schemes
- Full compatibility with screen readers and braille displays

This accessible design ensures that all users, regardless of visual ability, can enjoy Dedicon's audiobook collection comfortably.
