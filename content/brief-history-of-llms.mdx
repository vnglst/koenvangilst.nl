This is my attempt to tell the story of how AI became part of people's lives. Not the long history of deep learning and AI winters, but the part where AI became relevant for the masses. In just three years, large language models went from impressive novelty to useful intelligent companions that can reason and use tools. Here's how it happened.

## 2022 - ChatGPT

OpenAI launches ChatGPT. At first, it's mainly tech enthusiasts playing around with it, having fun with it and testing its limits. But in general everyone is impressed. For the first time, you can ask any question - literally anything - and get a coherent answer. You get feeling that the AI understands you.

## 2023 - RAG

The models get smarter: they can now see pictures and listen to audio. But there's still a fundamental limitation: they only know what's in their last training data. They don't learn anything new while talking to you. A model trained on 2023 data still thinks Biden is president. But quickly come up with a solution to this: if you give the model a document about current events or your company before asking questions, it learns from it on the spot. They call this Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and it's all everyone is talking about for a year.

## 2024 - Reasoning

Then researchers discover that if you give a model more time to think, the answer gets better. You can ask it: think through this in a few lines. But also: think through this in hundreds of pages. The longer the AI thinks, the better the answers get. Just like humans, really.

## 2025 - AI Agents

Now these things are coming together. An AI agent gets the time to think and has access to tools during that thinking process. Search the internet, check emails, query systems. The parallel with human history is striking: tools also caused an explosion in what we humans could do. The models aren't just getting much smarter through better training anymore, but also through longer thinking and using tools. And language models are surprisingly good at it.

## What This Means

The shift from 2022 to 2025 isn't just about better models. It's about how we've come to better use their capabilities. ChatGPT was reactive - it waited for your question and responded. Today's AI agents are proactive - they can break down complex tasks, gather information, use tools, and work through problems step by step.

The key insight: intelligence isn't just about having more knowledge. It's about having time to think and the right tools to work with. We've known this about humans for centuries. Now we're discovering it applies to this form of artificial intelligence too.
