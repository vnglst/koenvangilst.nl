It is a form of knowing that arises through touching, trying, correcting, feeling resistance, and through 'hands that think.'

This is a great observation. For software engineers coding is the way to fully grasp the business context and the details of the problem they or their company is trying to solve. By programming, they learn how the system fits together, where the limits are, and what is and isn't possible. From there they can discover new possibilities, but also assess whether new ideas are feasible.

If AI takes over the coding, that layer of knowledge disappears. Not just for the user, but for the software engineers themselves. The product becomes a black box. And yes, perhaps new craftsmanship emerges in directing the AI agent, but that doesn't build the same deep knowledge of what you're actually making.

"Computer says no" then becomes the endpoint more and more often, and there will be no human left who can explain why.
