summary: AI agents are changing how we build software. The shift isn't from developers to machines - it's from implementation to understanding, from reading code to orchestrating systems, from typing to thinking.

I've been collecting articles about AI agents lately. Some people are ecstatic about 10x productivity gains. Others [warn](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/18/agent-psychosis/) about developers losing themselves in endless agentic sessions at 3am. But these aren't contradictory stories. They're describing the same thing from different angles.

Peter Steinberger [said](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/shipping-at-inference-speed) something that stuck with me: "These days I don't read much code anymore. I watch the stream and sometimes look at key parts." I find myself doing the same. I write instructions, tell the agent what to build. The strange part? My programming skills matter more than ever. I'm just not using them to type characters anymore.

DHH is [ready to promote](https://world.hey.com/dhh/promoting-ai-agents-3ee04945) AI agents to production work. But then adds: "I'm nowhere close to having agents write 90%+ of the code... if I hold the line on quality and cohesion." That qualifier is everything. The [tension](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/18/agent-psychosis/) is real: AI agents make you incredibly productive, but only if you don't turn off your brain and let them generate whatever seems plausible.

There's an economic principle called Jevons' Paradox. When you make something more efficient, you don't use less of it - you use more. Better steam engines didn't reduce coal consumption in the 1800s. They enabled so many new applications that coal consumption exploded.

The same thing is happening with code. AI agents write code faster than humans ever could. So do we need fewer developers? No. We need more. Because the bottleneck was never typing speed. It was [understanding](https://russmiles.substack.com/p/you-cannot-outsource-understanding). The AI can generate the syntax, but someone still needs to understand what it means, why it's there, how it fits together. Every line of generated code is still a line that someone must understand, test, integrate, and operate.

The bottleneck shifted from implementation to specification. From typing to communication. Tickets rarely contain all the requirements. You need to ask questions that reveal assumptions people didn't know they had. Make calls on things nobody thought to specify. These things used to be optional for individual contributors. Now they're non-negotiable.

And here's the uncomfortable part: we won't be able to AI our way into better communication skills. Good communication requires empathy. Understanding that you cannot outsource.

The risk isn't that AI will replace us. The risk is that we'll turn off our critical thinking and let agents generate whatever seems plausible. At 3am, running your tenth parallel agent session, convincing yourself you've never been more productive - that's when you need to step away from the machine.

So coding might be dead soon, but the job is still there now. With less typing, more thinking. Less implementation, more understanding. For me the fun part was never really the typing anyway.
