It's the eternal battle between day and night, good and evil. I made this on a Friday afternoon as a short break from my other [side project](/lab/prognosis-2100) which started to feel a lot like work. After creating it I posted a video on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@vnglst/111828811496422610) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vnglst/status/1751278052154179770) and it became somewhat of an internet sensation. With currently more than 4 million views and 40.000 likes it's by far the most popular thing I ever did on the internet.

I first saw the idea for this [here](https://twitter.com/nicolasdnl/status/1749715070928433161), but it appears to be older than that. There's more information on the history in the [Hacknernews discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39159418). The colors are based on the Mindful Palette by [Alex Cristache](https://twitter.com/AlexCristache/status/1738610343499157872).
