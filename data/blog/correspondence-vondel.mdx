For my latest experiment with GenAI, I evaluated if GPT-4 could automate manual tasks in creating a critical edition of Joost van den Vondel's correspondence.

I used it to convert a scanned PDF to text, split it into individual letters, analyze details like sender, recipient, location, and date, and translate the letters to modern English from French, Latin, and 17th-century Dutch.

The results can be viewed [here](https://vondel.koenvangilst.nl/). The website is a simple static site that displays the letters in a list. Each letter is clickable and shows the text as generated by GPT-4o, the translation, and the extracted details.

As always when working with Large Language Models human oversight remains an important factor in each step of the process. It would be interesting to see how that oversight could work in this setting, but that's beyond the scope of this side-project. 

The code for this project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/vnglst/vondel-correspondence). It's a collection of Jupyter notebooks and a simple static website generated by Next.js.

This experiment confirms my earlier observations about Large Language Models that they can be simultaneously impressive and flawed. The LLM's ability to translate Dutch, French, and Latin into modern English was remarkable. Additionally, its extraction of dates, summaries, and geographical locations was really cool. However, no amount of prompting could make it understand how to split the text into individual letters.
