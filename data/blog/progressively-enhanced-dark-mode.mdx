title: 'Progressively enhanced dark mode'

summary: 'Adding a dark theme to my website using NextJS 13 and React Server Components'
---

I made an interesting and somewhat disappointing discovery today. I wanted to add a progressively enhanced dark mode to my website using a cookie (for persisting the user preference) and the `Sec-CH-Prefers-Color-Scheme` header. That way I could detect and select the correct color theme without using any client-side JavaScript. That seemed pretty cool and it works perfectly with the new NextJS 13 app folder and React Server Components.

There is, however, a catch. When I want to render my blog post routes NextJS showed the following error: `Dynamic server usage: headers`. Since I was using headers in my root `layout.tsx` it was not possible to statically generate my blog posts.

This makes sense of course: It's not possible to know ahead of time what kind of response the user is expecting since that depends on their headers/cookies.

Still, it's unclear to me what this means in terms of performance and costs. Will this mean that I opt out of any edge caching offered by Vercel? Will that make my website slow around the globe? Will it increase my server costs? It seems a pity that using something so fundamental to the web like a header or a cookie has so much impact on how a web framework behaves.

I'm still working on a minimal prototype of my progressively enhanced perfect dark mode implementation using NextJS, but in the meantime feel free to take a look at my open [pull request](https://github.com/vnglst/koenvangilst.nl/pull/131/files#diff-eca96d2c09f31517696a26e1d0be4070e1fbab02831481bed006e275741d030bR52) that adds in to this website.
