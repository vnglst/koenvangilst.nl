Two years ago, during the pandemic, I worked on a side project that allowed parents to create lessons for their kids to help them study. The idea was that parents would be able to share these lessons with others and by doing so create a library of lessons for other kids in primary school.

I enjoyed working on the app and letting my kids test drive it but quickly realized that creating new lessons was too time-consuming for busy parents. So I let the idea go and of the original project only the landing page and the source code remain.

Now with the arrival of smarter AIs like GPT, this could change. What if parents would only have to input the text of a homework assignment and then sit back and let the AI generate the questions for them?

After trying this out on ChatGPT to verify the idea I started sketching some designs for an app. This is how I imagine it. The app would feature an input box where users could type in the text they want to study.

Fill in the input text and click "Generate Questions". The app would leverage the GPT API to generate a set of questions.

It's also possible to edit the questions, answers and options. A feature that's still missing in this design is the possibility to discard certain questions and generated new ones. I've noticed that this iterative approach generally works well with LLM-based AIs.

Once you click to confirm a lesson with the selected question will be created and saved to the database. It will then appear on the user's dashboard.

Practicing the lesson could then look like this.

Beyond lessons based that practicing your understanding of a text I can also imagine other kinds of lessons. For instance:

- lessons to improve your vocabulary by letting the platform generate a list of difficult words in a text
- or generating a list of words that are key to understanding a German text with their English translations
- provide a link to a programming language documentation website and have the AI help you rehearse the syntax
- or linking to a YouTube video and generating questions based on the content
- provide a link to the lyrics of your favorite Spanish song and let the platform generate a vocabulary list for y

I think there's a lot of potential for this and I can't wait to get started on a proof of concept to verify that this could work. Until then I look forward to any feedback on this idea. Drop me a line on Mastodon or Twitter to let me know what you think!
