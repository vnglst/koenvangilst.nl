title: Accessible router links in Angular

summary: About the routerLink directive and how to make sure it's accessible
---

I've recently had to opportunity to learn and work with the Angular project within a project of experienced (and nice) frontend developers. To my surprise, there is a lot to like about Angular and I will write about that in a future post.

Today I'd like to discuss a feature of Angular that I think can be improved upon. I'm talking about the so-called [`routerLink`](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterLink#description) directive.

For developers, they're a super convenient way to make any element a clickable router link in your app. You can use them on regular anchor tags, but also on divs, buttons, SVGs, images and even you're own components. As I said, very convenient if you're a developer and in a hurry, but not a good practice if you care about semantic HTML and accessibility.

## Inaccessible routerLinks

Let me explain why that is. Let's first look at what happens if you use the `routerLink` the correct way, by using it on an anchor tag, like this:

```javascript
<a routerLink="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
```

This works great. In the DOM you'll see an anchor tag that looks like this:

```javascript
<a routerlink="/dashboard" ng-reflect-router-link="/profile" href="/dashboard">
  Dashboard
</a>
```

This enables fast client-side navigation, it's accessible and all the other functionalities that users expect from links (like opening it in a new tab) just work.

Now let's look at the example where a developer uses the `routerLink` directive on an `img` tag. Again, this is perfectly valid in Angular:

```javascript
<img src="/company-logo" routerLink="/" alt="company logo" />
```

The resulting DOM structure will look like this:

```javascript
<img
  routerlink="/"
  alt="company logo"
  src="company-logo"
  tabindex="0"
  ng-reflect-router-link="/">
```

This image will act like a link, navigating the user back to the homepage, but it won't be announced to the user as a link when using a screen reader and standard functionalities that users expect from a link (like opening it in a new tab) will also not work. In short: it's an image unsuccessfully pretending to be a link.

## How to fix this

These problems can be relatively easily fixed by using an anchor tag for routerLinks and wrapping any other HTML tags (like images) in those. It's the task of the Angular developer to not succumb to the temptations of the powerful routerLink directly and always do the right thing by only using it on anchor tags.

I would, however, like to argue that this problem shouldn't exist in the first place. If you look at routing solutions from the React ecosystem you'll notice that their `<Link />` components are always extending anchor tags.[^1] In that way, the default way of adding links to an application is automatically accessible and semantically correct. Of course, there are ways to programmatically force the router link behavior on other tags and components, but that's not recommended and not easy to do.

In the end, I think Angular should have chosen a similar path by letting the default way be accessible. This way automatically do the right thing which will make their lives a bit harder, but as a result, the users of Angular applications will have links that work in an accessible and reliable way.

Realistically speaking this is not something Angular could fix without introducing a breaking change, but I do think a note in their documentation about the recommended way of `routerLinks` (i.e. only use this on anchor tags, unless you know what you're doing) might be a quick win to make developers more aware of the issue.

    Most notably [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link) and
    [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link). [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/link-options) has a different approach where `<a>` elements are automatically upgraded to client-side navigation links. This is neat but also involves some magic that might not be obvious to developers.
