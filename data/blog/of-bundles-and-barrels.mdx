Until recently I've been an unequivocal fan of so-called barrel files. They work like this:

```ts
// src/components/index.js
export * from './Foo';
export * from './Bar';
export * from './FooBar';
```

Which allows you to use components like this:

```ts
import { Foo, Bar, FooBar } from 'src/components';
```

Short and sweet! For this reason, I'm also a happy user of the VSCode plugin [Auto-barrel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikehanson.auto-barrel) which helps with creating/updating these barrel files.

I did recently discover, however, that this pattern can have unwanted side effects. Re-exporting all your imports in an index file can result in large bundle sizes.

I gave it a try on one of the projects I'm working on (using Next.js) and lo and behold: Removing the barrel in the `/components/ui` folder reduced the initial bundle size by more than 35kb. The culprit: In the `ui` folder was a `RichTextEditor` component of 35 kB. Since it was re-exported this was included on every page using a component from the ui folder.

So be careful what you put in your barrels, if you care about bundle size!
