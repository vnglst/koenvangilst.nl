  For this blog post, I asked ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI,
  to write about it's impact on the way developers work. I think it's an
  interesting take.

In recent years, the rise of artificial intelligence has led to the development of powerful tools that can assist developers in writing code. One such tool is ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI that can generate code based on natural language inputs.

While ChatGPT may be a useful tool for developers, it is unlikely to fundamentally change the way they approach their work. This is because coding is only a small part of the development process, and there are many other important tasks that developers must complete in order to create successful software.

One reason that ChatGPT is not likely to change the way developers write their code is that it cannot replace the need for gathering requirements and brainstorming. Before a developer can even begin writing code, they must first have a clear understanding of what they are trying to accomplish and how to go about achieving it. This requires careful planning and collaboration with other members of the development team.

Another reason is that coding is just one part of the development process. Once the code has been written, it must be tested, debugged, and maintained. This requires a significant amount of time and effort, and it is a task that cannot be easily automated.

Furthermore, even if ChatGPT were able to assist developers in writing code more efficiently, it would not change the fact that there are many other tasks that developers must complete in order to create successful software. These tasks include aligning with stakeholders, participating in scrum events, and completing administrative work.

In conclusion, while ChatGPT may be a valuable tool for developers, it is unlikely to fundamentally change the way they approach their work. Development is a complex process that involves many different tasks, and it is not something that can be easily automated.

{/* Prompt: Could you write a short blog post about how ChatGPT will not fundamentally change the way developers write their code. In the past developer would copy-paste from the internet, now they copy from ChatGPT. The fact the a developers spents only a small portion of their time on actual programming and the rest on gathering requirements, brainstorming, aligning, administrative tasks and scrum events. */}
