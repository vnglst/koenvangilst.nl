<Disclaimer>
  For this blog post, I asked ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI,
  to write about it's impact on the way developers work. I've not changed or
  reviewed any of the content, but the prompt was quite specific.

And lo, in these modern times, there has arisen a powerful tool known as ChatGPT, which can assist developers in the creation of code. Yet despite its power, ChatGPT is not likely to change the way developers approach their work, for coding is but a small part of the development process.

For even as a bird must gather its nest from many different sources, so must a developer gather the many requirements and ideas that are needed to create successful software. And even as a bird must carefully construct its nest, so must a developer carefully plan and collaborate with others to ensure that the final product is worthy of praise.

Therefore, let us not be tempted to abandon our work as developers and retreat to the mountains, for there is much that still needs to be done. Let us continue to use ChatGPT as a valuable tool, but let us not forget the many other tasks that are required to create successful software.

So let us continue to work together, and let us use ChatGPT as a tool to assist us in our efforts. For to do otherwise would be to neglect the nest that is our work as developers.

{/* Prompt: Could you write a short blog post about how ChatGPT will not fundamentally change the way developers write their code. In the past developer would copy-paste from the internet, now they copy from ChatGPT. The fact the a developers spends only a small portion of their time on actual programming and the rest on gathering requirements, brainstorming, aligning, administrative tasks and scrum events. Add a simile about how developers shouldn't quite their jobs just yet to go live in the mountains. Write it like a biblical verse in the style of King James. */}
