summary: How to let screenreaders read the title of an SVG using React

<Disclaimer>
  **tl;dr**
  
  If your SVG is just decorative add `aria-hidden="true"`. If not, add a `<title>` tag to improve accessiblity.
  Read on if you want general browser support (Safari in particular).
</Disclaimer>

With `<title>` tags you can let screenreader users know what a SVG represents. However, browser support is not quite there yet. So for instance VoiceOver on Mac + Safari does not read titles to the user.

You can use some aria magic to fix this:

```jsx
export const PlayIcon = () => (
  <svg
    aria-labelledby=“play-id”
    role="img"
    viewBox="0 0 24 24"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  >
    <title id="play-id">play</title>
    <path d="M8 5v14l11-7z" />
    <path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none" />
  </svg>
);
```

The challenge with this approach is that html `id`s have to be unique. And when you have a lot of PlayIcons on your screen, this can get problematic. A way to solve this is to generate some kind of unique id for every icon in the DOM, but to me this feels like engineering overkill.

## Hiding SVGs from screenreaders

Sometimes you want to hide the SVGs entirely from screenreaders, for instance when you have a button that already has a label and the icon is just a visual decoration that does not add any indispensable information. In that case you can use `aria-hidden` to make sure it's not picked up by screenreaders (just as a empty string as alt tag (`alt=""`) hides images).

In general I also want leave the decision whether or not an SVG should have an accessible title to the parent component. So I ended up with the following React component:

```jsx
export const PlayIcon = ({ accessibleTitle }) => (
  <svg
    aria-labelledby={accessibleTitle ? 'playid' : null}
    aria-hidden={accessibleTitle ? false : true}
    role="img"
    viewBox="0 0 24 24"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  >
    {accessibleTitle && <title id="playid">play</title>}
    <path d="M8 5v14l11-7z" />
    <path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none" />
  </svg>
);
```

And you would use it like so:

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <button>
    <PlayIcon accessibleTitle="play" />
  </button>
);
```

## Browser support

Browser support for using **only a `<title>` tag** is getting better. As of 25th August, 2019 it look like this:

- VoiceOver + Chrome: WORKS ✅
- VoiceOver + Chromium (new Edge + Brave): WORKS ✅
- VoiceOver + Safari 12 + 13: DOES NOT ❌
- VoiceOver + Firefox: (_how do I get this to work, somebody know?_)

- NVDA + Chrome: WORKS ✅
- NVDA + Edge: WORKS ✅
- NVDA + Firefox: DOES NOT ❌

Note that on Firefox the solution with `aria-labelledby` causes NVDA to read the icon name twice.
