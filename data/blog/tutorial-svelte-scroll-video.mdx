summary: Tutorial on how to create a scroll video effect using Svelteâ€™s powerful bind command.
---

In this tutorial Iâ€™ll show you how svelteâ€™s bind command can be used to create a cool scroll video effect with very little code. The effect weâ€™ll be creating plays a video when the user scrolls up or down. Below is a gif of [how this looks on the NYTimes website](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/30/world/middleeast/syria-turkey-maps.html)

<video
  width="672"
  height="577"

  muted
  loop
  controls
></video>

**Note:** the effect itself is a lot smoother than the gifs ðŸ˜‚. Another example can be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/09/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion.html)). The effect is also sometimes used on product landing pages. Here's an example on [Apple's page for the iMac Pro](https://www.apple.com/imac-pro/).

<video
  width="672"
  height="577"

  controls
></video>

It gives web pages a very dynamic look and I was surprised to learn how easy you can accomplish this with svelte.

## Setting up svelte

Following the instructions on the [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev) homepage we run the following commands to get started with svelte:

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template scroll-video
npm install
npm run dev
```

A new svelte project is now running on: http://localhost:5000

We start with an empty `App.svelte` file, so letâ€™s delete all the code in that file first.

## Scrolling formula

When the user scrolls down the page, we want the video the play forward. To accomplish this we'll set the current video position using the following formula:

```js
currentTime = duration * scrollY / total scroll height
```

where:

- currentTime = the play position in the video
- duration = total playing time of the video
- scrollY = the current vertical scroll position

## Binding variables

Now that we figured out what the formula is going to be, letâ€™s see how we can read these values by using svelteâ€™s _variable binding_.

We can get the vertical scrolling position with the following code:

```html
<script>
  let scrollY;
</script>

<svelte:window bind:scrollY />
```

Here we are binding the vertical scroll position of the window to a variable _scrollY_. Before we can continue, we have to make sure our window is heigh enough to allow for scrolling. Letâ€™s add a `div` and some CSS for that:

```html
<script>
  let scrollY;
</script>

<svelte:window bind:scrollY />

<div class="scroll-container" />

<style>
  .scroll-container {
    height: 5000px;
  }
</style>
```

Notice how you can combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript within a svelte component. Almost like you would in a regular HTML file!

To verify if this works you might be tempted to add a _console.log_ just below the line `let scrollY;`. If you try that however youâ€™ll see only one `0` being logged. The reason for this is that any code inside the `<script>` will run only once (when initialising the component). If you want to keep executing the _console.log_ as the scroll values updates, make it reactive using the following notation:

```js
$: console.log(scrollY);
```

This may look a bit funky (and it is! Iâ€™m not even sure if itâ€™s still JavaScript) but youâ€™ll get used to it.

After adding the console.log with the dollar sign, you should see the scroll position logged on every update. Pretty cool for just 2 lines of code!

Similarly we can use bind on `<video>` to get the other values:

```html {3,4,11-18}
<script>
  let scrollY;
  let time;
  let duration;
</script>

<svelte:window bind:scrollY />

<div class="scroll-container" />

<video
  bind:currentTime="{time}"
  bind:duration
  preload="metadata"
  muted
  src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/23/turkey-syria-video-upload/71ab097907156ca46fb7ffd4d21dfbd119fb47e8/syria-turkey-reconstruct-7-800.mp4"
  type="video/mp4"
/>

<style>
  .scroll-container {
    height: 5000px;
  }
</style>
```

The cool thing about these bindings is that they are **bidirectional**. This means that the `time` variable not only holds the current playback time, but that if we change it, weâ€™re also updating the current playback position of the video! This is also known as _two-way data binding_ which was initially popularized by the original _AngularJS_.

In the next section we'll combine this with the formula we made earlier.

## Updating video playback on scroll

Before we can continue we first have to make sure the video is always displayed fullscreen on the background while we are scrolling. Let's add a container _div_ and some CSS to accomplish that:

```html {11,20, 23-39}
<script>
  let scrollY;
  let time;
  let duration;
</script>

<svelte:window bind:scrollY />

<div class="scroll-container" />

<div class="video-container">
  <video
    bind:currentTime="{time}"
    bind:duration
    preload="metadata"
    muted
    src="https://int.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/beirut-explosion-video/main/warehouse-800.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</div>

<style>
  .video-container {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  .video-container video {
    min-width: 100%;
    min-height: 100%;
    width: auto;
    height: auto;
    position: fixed;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  }

  .scroll-container {
    height: 5000px;
  }
</style>
```

Any changes in the scroll position should immediately be reflected in a change in the playback position. In other words: the changes in the time variable should react to the changes in the scroll position. To accomplish this we have to make sure our formule code is **reactive**. Just as with the console.log we use the `$:` notation to do this:

```html {2,5,7-11}
<script>
  let time = 0;
  let duration;

  let scrollY = 0;

  $: {
    const totalScroll =
      document.documentElement.scrollHeight - window.innerHeight;
    time = duration * (scrollY / totalScroll);
  }
</script>
```

## Result

After adding the last piece of code the video scroll effect should work. To make the scroll effect more visible I've also added a heading and some content blocks. You can see the complete feature in the [Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/850d34e7f22b4a13935a078b62c2e19a?version=3.29.7) below.

## Notes on performance

The NYTimes is using optimized, small size videos on their pages. And with good reason: I've been doing experiments with larger (high definition) videos and it's impossible to get the performance right on all browsers: Safari performs surprisingly well, but Firefox and Chrome quickly start to stutter when the video gets larger.

Apple is actually using a different technique to accomplish the effect on their pages: They've split up the video in separate frames (images) and they show a different frame when the scroll position changes. This [technique](https://css-tricks.com/lets-make-one-of-those-fancy-scrolling-animations-used-on-apple-product-pages/) performs suprisingly well, even for high definition video content. It does, however, come at a cost: All those frames have to be downloaded individually, adding up to huge download sizes. This is costly not just for mobile end users, but also if you're hosting them.

If you want to use this technique and keep things simple I suggest using a small and optimized video just like the NYTimes does.

For anyone interested in the performance aspects of this effect: I've tweeted about this here (with a demo site): https://twitter.com/vnglst/status/1307681819635183616
