Rarely does a day pass without some news of our changing climate. Here in the Netherlands, we're also experiencing this firsthand â€“ our summers are hotter and our winters milder. In this blog post, I've tried to visually capture these changes. By using temperature data from the Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI), I've created two visualizations that show how the average temperature in The Netherlands has changed since the 1900s.

## Yearly temperature anomalies

The first visualization presents the yearly temperature anomalies in The Netherlands from 1901 to 2023. The data, sourced from a [weather station in De Bilt](https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/nieuws/120-jaar-weerstation-de-bilt), is based on the average temperature of each year, compared to the average temperature of the period 1901-2000. This visualization is designed to be interactive, allowing users to hover over the graph to see the exact temperature anomaly for each year.

## Heatmap of monthly temperature anomalies

The second visualization shows the monthly temperature anomalies in The Netherlands from 1901 to 2023. I'm using a heatmap to visualize the data, where the color of each cell represents the temperature anomaly for that month. So if you see a lot of red, it means that the temperature was higher than average; if it's blue, the temperature was lower than average.

The data is based on the average temperature of each month, compared to the average temperature of the period 1901-2000. Like the previous chart, the data is sourced from a [weather station in De Bilt](https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/nieuws/120-jaar-weerstation-de-bilt).

## Source code

The source code of these charts is open source and available on Github (see link below). I still have to open-source the data processing scripts in Python and I'll update this blog post when I do. A link to the data source can be found [here](https://cdn.knmi.nl/knmi/map/page/klimatologie/gegevens/maandgegevens/mndgeg_260_tg.txt).
