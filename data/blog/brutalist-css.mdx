## Bare minimum responsive CSS

CSS can be hard, but getting started with responsive design doesn't have to be. These are the only 196 bytes you need to get started with a responsive design.

```css
body {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial,
    sans-serif;
  font-size: 24px;
  line-height: 1.6;
  max-width: 38rem;
  padding: 2rem;
  margin: auto;
}
```
