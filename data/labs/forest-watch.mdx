I created a demo using the [ArcGIS SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) by Esri. This demo leverages data from the [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/) to visualize changes in tree cover over time and compare different geographical areas.

Unfortunately, the Forest Watch demo is currently offline, but I hope to bring it back in the future. To provide you with an idea of its appearance, Iâ€™ve included screenshots below.

## Screenshots

The following images depict an area near my house in The Netherlands:

- Pink Layer: Indicates trees that have been removed within the last 10 years.
- Blue Layer: Represents tree growth.

The next screenshot demonstrates the history feature which allows users to journey back in time and observe changes in tree cover. By selecting specific layers, they can see how tree landscapes have evolved over different periods. In the screenshot, I've selected a layer from the year 2020. You can see that the area was then still covered in trees.
