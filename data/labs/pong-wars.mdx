Recently I've been having a lot of fun building visualizations in JavaScript using just the canvas and some HTML & CSS. Here's an overview of some of the things I made.

- [Time Flies](#time-flies)
- [Particle Life](#particle-life)
- [Aarde](#aarde)
- [Dancing Mosquitoes](#dancing-mosquitoes)
- [Pong Wars](#pong-wars)
- [Purple Rain](#purple-rain)
- [Voronoi Virus](#voronoi-virus)
- [Rock Paper Scissors](#rock-paper-scissors)


## Time Flies

Insects, time and how it always seems to fly by too fast. Original idea by [Menno Anker](http://mennoanker.nl)

## Particle Life

This weekend's coding session was dedicated to recreating Jeffery Ventrella's "Particle Life". I had a lot of fun with it. So strange that I've never encountered this algorithm before!

## Aarde

Old school artificial life. Inspired by [Tierra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_(computer_simulation)), in a much simplified form.

The programming language in which the life forms are written has 5 instructions:

- S - Program start 
- E - Program end 
- F - Find location to copy to 
- C - Copy to location
- J - Jump to start of program

Every time a code is copied a mutation can occur. We start with the following simple life form:

SFCJE

The rest is evolution.

## Dancing Mosquitoes

I created this on a dreary winter day. The rain and lack of sunlight got me thinking about hot summer evenings & the mesmerizing mosquito dance.

## Pong Wars

It's the eternal battle between day and night, good and evil. I made this on a Friday afternoon as a short break from my other [side project](/labs/prognosis-2100) which started to feel a lot like work. After creating it I posted a video on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@vnglst/111828811496422610) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vnglst/status/1751278052154179770) and it became somewhat of an internet sensation. With currently more than 4 million views and 40.000 likes it's by far the most popular thing I ever did on the internet.

I first saw the idea for this [here](https://twitter.com/nicolasdnl/status/1749715070928433161), but it appears to be older than that. There's more information on the history in the [Hacknernews discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39159418). The colors are based on the Mindful Palette by [Alex Cristache](https://twitter.com/AlexCristache/status/1738610343499157872).

## Purple Rain

With Valentineâ€™s Day around the corner, I created Purple Rain. It's a simple visualization of raindrops falling down the screen. The palette is based on the [Mindful Palette Nr. 38](https://twitter.com/AlexCristache/status/1749703514409111961) by Alex Cristache.

## Voronoi Virus

When I was a kid in high school, a friend and I would exchange floppy disks with demos on them. At that time I was happy to be able to draw a couple of circles on the screen so I was very impressed when he showed me his demo. It was similar to this and it even had movement. I couldn't believe he was able to do that (I still think he had help from his father!).

## Rock Paper Scissors

Not sure where this is going, but I like the way it looks already. The demo simulates cellular growth, following the rules of rock, paper and scissors. To make it a bit more interesting I've made it possible for older cells to withstand a few attacks by enemies.
