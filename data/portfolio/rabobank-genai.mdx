In my previous role as a lead frontend engineer, I had the chance to guide web engineers and push the boundaries of web applications. Now, as a Tech Lead, I'm continuing to come up with new ideas, especially with the exciting possibilities that GenAI technologies bring.

In this new role, I get to oversee the technical side of some really cool projects, focusing on how we can use GenAI. Here’s a bit of what I do:

- **Experimenting with New Ideas**: I love evaluating the technical feasibility of new concepts and getting hands-on with experiments, especially in the early stages.
- **Building and Supporting Teams**: Creating and supporting teams to run experiments and develop proof-of-concept solutions is a big part of my job. I make sure our developers have everything they need to work efficiently.
- **Finding the Right Resources**: Whether it’s recruiting new engineers or identifying the technical resources we need, I handle it.
- **Collaborating with Others**: I work closely with Product Owners and Solution Architects to make sure our technical execution aligns with our product goals.
- **Smooth Transitions**: I help facilitate the transition from experimentation to MVP development, coordinating with business lines to ensure everything goes smoothly.
