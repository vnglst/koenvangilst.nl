As a Tech Lead, I oversee the technical execution of innovative projects, focusing on the engineering aspects of GenAI use cases. Key responsibilities include:

- **Technical Feasibility and Experimentation**: Evaluating the technical viability of new ideas and designing hands-on technical experiments, particularly in early-stage development.

- **Team Building and Support**: Creating and supporting teams to conduct experiments and develop proof-of-concept (POC) solutions, ensuring developers can work efficiently.

- **Technical Resourcing**: Identifying and acquiring necessary technical resources, including recruiting new engineers.

- **Collaborative Execution**: Working closely with Product Owners and Solution Architects to align technical execution with product goals.

- **Handover and Transition**: Facilitating the transition from experimentation to MVP development, coordinating with business lines for smooth handover.
