I know a lot of people just use the [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) website for decoding JWT tokens, but to me that always feels unsecure.
It's definitely safer to use a command line tool on your own computer for that. I use the following [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) command for that.

```bash
jq -R 'split(".") | .[1] | @base64d | fromjson' <<< ".... paste token here...."
```
