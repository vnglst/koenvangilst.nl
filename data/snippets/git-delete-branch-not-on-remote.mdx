```bash
git branch -vv | grep ': gone]'|  grep -v "\*" | awk '{ print $1; }' | xargs -r git branch -d
```

Useful for cleaning up a local repository with lots of stale branches.
The script can also be used with the -D flag (instead of -d).
This will delete all local branches, even if they have any unmerged changes.
