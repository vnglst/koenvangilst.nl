Based on this [excellent ðŸ”¥ tip](https://mobile.twitter.com/wesbos/status/1588520765380612098) by Wes Bos.
Some great other tips in that thread and I'm summarizing them here for future reference.

Add the following to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
trash() {
  echo "[x] moving files to trash..."
  mv "$@" "$HOME/.trash"
}
```

Now instead of using `rm -rf node_modules` you can now use `trash node_modules`. Which is:

- faster, milliseconds instead of minutes
- safer, you can always restore files if you make a mistake

Other options:

- a [Node.js based cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash-cli) by @sindresorhus
