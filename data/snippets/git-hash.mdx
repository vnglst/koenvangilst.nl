It's often useful to have a Git hash shown somewhere to help determine which version
you're looking at. This snippet will add to a Next.js app as an
environment variable.

```ts
const pkg = require('./package.json');

// starts a command line process to get the git hash
const commitHash = require('child_process')
  .execSync('git log --pretty=format:"%h" -n1')
  .toString()
  .trim();

module.exports = {
  // other configs
  env: {
    // add the package.json version and git hash to the environment
    APP_VERSION: pkg.version,
    COMMIT_HASH: commitHash
  }
};
```

You can then use it in your code like this (example taken from this website):

```jsx
<span className="text-gray-500 text-right text-xs my-4">
  v. {process.env.APP_VERSION} |{' '}
  <a
    className="underline"
    href={`https://github.com/vnglst/koenvangilst.nl/tree/${process.env.COMMIT_HASH}`}
  >
    {process.env.COMMIT_HASH}
  </a>
</span>
```

Or if you don't want to expose the hash in the frontend, you can attach it
to the `window` object:

```ts
window.APP_VERSION = pkg.version;
window.COMMIT_HASH = commitHash;
```
