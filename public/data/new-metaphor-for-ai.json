When asked about implications for today's AI, she said we need a new metaphor for thinking about our intelligent companions. The dominant one for the past two decades has been the Terminator - Skynet coming back to destroy us all. Metaphors shape our thinking and determine the opportunities we see. She gave another example: when people talk about declining insect populations as an \"insect apocalypse,\" it makes the trend seem inevitable, as if there's nothing humans can do about the demise of all insect life. The metaphor hides the fact that we're responsible for the decline and removes our agency. The same thing happens with the AI discourse when we default to the Terminator metaphor.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:['So what is a better metaphor for thinking about AI?

AIs are being used as assistants and many think they will impact our human endeavors - not just scientific research, but medicine, arts and technology. Their main contributions may be that they compress enormous amounts of human knowledge into a single interface. In that sense, they are giants - of information and compressed human insight. I've been experimenting with this myself while programming: when I use them, I'm not handing over control, I'm climbing on top of their capabilities.
