I'm a software tinkerer and web enthusiast who loves bringing beautiful, fun, and educational creations to life using code.

I have a diverse background, always at the intersection of technology and humanity, with a philosophy degree and a lifelong passion for coding. I started programming at around 11, using GW-Basic and Turbo Pascal. After my studies and working as a translator for years, I returned to programming as a web developer. Now I am in a technical leadership role where I experiment with new AI ideas and build teams.

I currently work at [Rabobank](https://www.rabobank.com), where I help users getting their work done faster and with less friction. To do this I experiment with GenAI by building technical prototypes and collaborating closely with business stakeholders and engineers, guiding projects from initial experimentation to successful products in the hands of our users.

In my spare time, I enjoy coding side projects that often complement my professional work - a great way to stay up to date with trends and keep learning.
