## Online Registratie

At the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK), I contributed as a frontend engineer in the development of the application that allows starting entrepreneurs (freelancers) to register their new businesses online. With _Online Registratie_, the KVK meets the broad societal need to conduct transactions (with government entities) online.

This application went live nationally at the end of 2019 and is used annually by more than 200,000 starting freelancers. Users rate this application highly (highest satisfaction score of the KVK).

Since June 2020, it has also been possible for users to complete the registration entirely online. This uses a special technology that also carries out the identification process (with a passport check) entirely digitally. As a result, visiting one of the KVK offices is no longer required for registering a business.
