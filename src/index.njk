      I'm a software tinkerer and web enthusiast who loves bringing beautiful, fun, and educational creations to
      life using code.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a diverse background, always at the intersection of technology and humanity, with a philosophy degree
      and a lifelong passion for coding. I started programming at around 11, using GW-Basic and Turbo Pascal. After
      my studies and working as a translator for years, I returned to programming as a web developer. Now I am in a
      technical leadership role where I experiment with new AI ideas and build teams.

    <p>
      I currently work at <a href="https://www.rabobank.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rabobank</a>, where I help users getting their
      work done faster and with less friction. To do this I experiment with GenAI by building technical prototypes
      and collaborating closely with business stakeholders and engineers, guiding projects from initial
      experimentation to successful products in the hands of our users.
    </p>

    <p>
      So far, my work aligns with my passion for technology. In my spare time, I enjoy coding side projects that
      often complement my professional work - a great way to stay up to date with trends and keep learning. On this
      website, you'll find a selection of my <a href="/lab/">side projects</a>,
      <a href="/lab/">articles</a>, and <a href="/lab/gen-art-gallery/">generative art</a> from
      over the years.
