          Hello! I'm Koen, an enthusiastic and entrepreneurial Tech Lead from the Netherlands who's into building GenAI
          apps that users love. Recently, I started on a new journey with Rabobank, stepping into the role of Tech Lead
          for GenAI. In this position, my aim is to guide others through Rabobank's sometimes complex environment,
          fostering a community where developers can easily seek assistance, engage in code reviews and collectively
          grow. Of course, I'll continue coding myself â€“ an aspect of my career that I love and wouldn't dream of giving
          up!
        </p>
